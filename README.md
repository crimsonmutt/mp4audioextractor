mp4 Audio Extractor

A program that takes mp4 tracks and extracts the audio.
Not really complicated, now, is it?

If you compile it yourself, keep in mind that the Tools folder needs to be in the root folder of the main .exe
I have no idea how to make it do it automatically and I cannot be arsed to look it up at 3 am.
